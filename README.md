- Initial Barracks (兵营), allied and soviet, that is required for summoning Rocketeers. They should be placed on wall like paintings.
- Rocketeers (火箭飞行兵), very like what they are in RA2.

## Development Notes

For convenience, this repository contain nothing from RA2 i.e. textures and sounds are missing. If you want them, try extracting a release.

There's a html helper in `OtherHelpers` folder that can add paddings to texture images.

You can extract RA2 resources with XCC Mixer. May need Windows 7 or *earlier* (virtual machine is fine).
