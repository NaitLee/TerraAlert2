# TerraAlert2
*★ Implements some Red Alert 2 things to Terraria ☭*

## Play!

It's still in development. Testing only.

Just obtain the newest release and install the mod with tML. Be sure to enable it.

## Status

- Initial Barracks (兵营), allied and soviet, that is required for summoning Rocketeers & Conscripts. They should be placed on wall like paintings.
- Rocketeers (火箭飞行兵), very like what they are in RA2.
- Conscripts (动员兵), have a little dumb AI.
- Recipes are wood related. Consult the Guide for them.
- ... please wait for more

## Development Notes

For convenience, this repository contains only code, i.e. textures and sounds are missing. If you want them, try extracting a release.

There's a html helper in `OtherHelpers` folder that can add paddings to texture images.

You can extract RA2 resources with XCC Mixer. May need Windows 7 or *earlier* (virtual machine is fine).
